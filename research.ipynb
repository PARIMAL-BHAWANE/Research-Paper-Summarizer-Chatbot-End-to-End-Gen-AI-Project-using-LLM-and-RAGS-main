The most common and heavily used MEMS inertial\\nsensors are gyroscopes and accelerometers used in consumer devices and automotive [ 1,2].\\nThe advancement in the silicon MEMS/CMOS technology at both chip and device levels has\\nenabled further improvement of MEMS sensors in terms of miniaturization, high accuracy,\\nhigh quality and performance at low cost.

AI Components, types, and sub-ﬁelds [16].\\n2. MEMS Background\\nIn this section, we brieﬂy introduce the MEMS-based system. MEMS devices are\\nrugged, small, and silicon-based and are fabricated in the micrometer range with advanced\\ntechnologies, such as semiconductor manufacturing. MEMS involves electrical and mechan-\\nical components fabricated using Integrated circuits (IC) batch processing at the micrometer\\nscale [ 17]. Often, multiple devices are fabricated into a single chip, and cross-signal interac-\\ntion and interference are unavoidable. This is why new failure modes are introduced and\\nmust be taken care of efﬁciently.\\nFigure 3 depicts a simpliﬁed MEMS manufacturing process. After the design, process\\nsimulation, layout, and mask generation, the micro-fabrication process starts with a sili-\\ncon substrate. The material deposition, pattern transfer, and excess material removal run\\nmultiple cycles until the desired result is achieved. Compared to traditional IC fabrication\\ntechniques, thicker ﬁlms and deeper etching lead to fewer cycles to achieve the desired\\nresult. Special probing and sectioning techniques are used to protect the parts. Testing and\\ncalibration are crucial in the MEMS manufacturing process to retain high quality and relia-\\nbility. The complexity comes from the spatial distribution of the wafers, the process-induced\\neffects, and the combination of both. Moreover, complexity plays such an important role\\nbecause the useful signal from the MEMS and the degree of ﬂuctuations/effects from the\\nprocess (temperature, pressure, mechanical stress, gas concentration, etc.) are much more\\ncomparable than in the case of a macroscopic product. At the same time, the expectation is\\nthat each product has the same properties compared to its speciﬁcation.'),\n",

MEMS Manufacturing Process.\\nIn comparison to traditional sensors, MEMS-based sensors provide signiﬁcant advan-\\ntages, such as (i) low production cost, (ii) less power consumption, (iii) improved sensing in\\nterms of accuracy and sensitivity, (iv) lightweight, (v) more diminutive size, (vi) high and\\nstraightforward integration, (vii) parallelism, (viii) resilient to shock, vibration, and radia-\\ntion, (xi) scalability, etc. MEMS-based gyroscopes and accelerometers were ﬁrst developed\\naround the 1990s for automotive applications, triggering the high demand for consumer\\nelectronics. Mid-2000 marked the boom of MEMS sensors by incorporating MEMS sensors\\ninto Nintendo’s Wii. Later, a high adaptation rate could be seen in other areas, such as\\nsmartphones, microphones, motion detection, image stabilization, home security, wearable\\ndevices, such as ﬁtness watches, the automotive industry, military, unmanned aerial vehi-\\ncles (UAV), air crafts, etc. Due to more interest and research in autonomous vehicles, it has\\nbecome more critical than ever.\\nMEMS’s current market size value in 2022 is 14.32 billion USD and is projected to\\nreach 75 billion USD by 2032 with a global growth rate of 18.01% from 2022–2032 [ 18].\\nAdvancements in new technology, such as sensor fusion, big data, AI, and the industrial\\ninternet of things, created opportunities for new application areas, such as smart homes,\\nconnected cars, and autonomous vehicles.\\n2.1. MEMS Components\\nAs can be seen from Figure 4, MEMS are not only sensors; MEMS components can be\\nsubdivided into four categories, (1) microelectronics, (2) microactuators, (3) microsensors,\\nand (4) microstructures, which are integrated into a single chip. Microsensors sense the\\nphysical parameters and detect changes in stimuli, such as pressure, temperature, motion,\\nmass, light, etc. The microelectronics then process and analyze the collected information,\\nwhich sends the signal to the microactuators. Upon receiving the signal, the microactuators\\nrespond and provide outputs as a change in the environment. MEMS components are\\npackaged together with an application-speciﬁc integrated circuit (ASIC), which acts as\\nan electrical interface among the components to send and receive analog and digital\\ninformation. This makes the calibration and packaging processes quite complicated. As\\ndiscussed so far, MEMS technology and related components are diverse, and the discussion\\nof this paper is limited to only MEMS-based sensors.\\nTypes of MEMS Sensors and Applications\\nBased on the received responses and measured quantity , the microsensors used in MEMS\\ncan be broadly divided into different types, such as physical, chemical, and biological.\\nTable 1 shows a high-level classiﬁcation of the microsensors used in MEMS-based\\nsystems [ 19] based on the received signal.

It will\\nbe later seen, in Section 4, that the contributions made in MEMS inertial sensors are pretty\\nimpressive. We will brieﬂy discuss the working principle of the most important types, such\\nas accelerometers and gyroscopes. This will help understand the problem’s complexity and\\nthe contribution made by researchers using AI.\\nIn general, accelerometers can be divided into two categories based on the response\\ntype, such as (1) AC-response and (2) DC-response. AC-response accelerometers consist of\\npiezoelectric elements for sensing. Thus, they are also known as piezoelectric accelerome-\\nters. The piezoelectric element “displaces” a charge when the accelerometer experiences\\nacceleration, resulting in an electrical output proportional to acceleration. DC-response\\naccelerometers can be of two types: piezoresistive (mainly used for low-range devices) and\\ncapacitive (high accuracy and sensitivity). They make use of MEMS fabrication technology,\\nwhich scales to big-volume applications and lowers the cost of production. The advantages\\nof using a MEMS-based accelerometer over a piezoelectric accelerometer are (i) active\\nself-test, (ii) can measure both dynamic and static movement, (iii) generates precise velocity\\nand displacement information, (iv) excellent bias stability and minimal noise, etc.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\Data Science Projects\\\\Research Paper Summarizer Chatbot\\\\Research-Paper-Summarizer-Chatbot-End-to-End-Gen-AI-Project-using-LLM-and-RAGS\\\\resource\\\\Artificial Intelligence Applications for MEMS-Based Sensors.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Telecom 2023 ,4 170\\nThe most commonly used MEMS accelerometer is the capacitive type, which is the\\ncheapest and smallest. The accelerometer can be a single-axis, where acceleration is mea-\\nsured or a multi-axis, where the orientation of gravity is measured as well. The accelerome-\\nter measures acceleration in terms of movement, shock, or vibration. The basic working\\nprinciple can be explained with a mass suspended on a spring attached to a ﬁxed frame,\\ni.e., a comb capacitor plate. In the presence of an external force, the mass moves, and the\\ndistance between the ﬁxed plate and the seismic mass changes. This further changes the\\ncapacitance between the set and the movable plate [ 20,21]. The challenge of this design\\nis to provide DC accuracy over temperature and reduce the temperature drift and bias\\ndrift as much as possible. The drift compensation by AI algorithm has become an attrac-\\ntive research topic. From an application perspective, MEMS accelerometers are used in\\nsmartphones, airbags in cars, cameras for anti-blur, real time applications, such as the\\nmilitary, etc.\\nMEMS vibratory gyroscopes measure the angular rate of rotation or displacement by\\nusing Coriolis force. Based on the transduction type, a MEMS gyroscope can be of different\\ntypes, such as silicon tuning fork, quartz tuning fork, vibratory ring, etc. The purpose of\\na gyroscope is to measure the acceleration of its oscillating mechanical sensing compo-\\nnents. The mechanical structure remains in active resonance, and a small displacement\\nas a response is produced due to Coriolis acceleration [ 22]. Managing this quadrature\\nsignal requires a clever gyroscope design so that the small signal is detectable. This is why\\nmany electronic compensation methods exist to de-noise the signal. Thus, noise modeling,\\nrandom drift construction, temperature drift compensation, fault detection, and diagno-\\nsis of the gyroscope have become some of the most lucrative ﬁelds of interest for data\\nscientists. The main application areas can be found in stability control in the automotive in-\\ndustry, short-range navigation, such as missile navigation, image stabilization in industrial\\napplications, submarines, UAVs, aeronautics navigation, etc.\\n2.2. MEMS Manufacturing Process\\nThe MEMS manufacturing process is an extensive and time-consuming endeavor\\nthat requires numerous quality checks before completing the entire process. The design\\nrequires simultaneously considering devices from electrical, mechanical, and electronic\\ndomains. Not only that, the design should consider the cross-domain effect and analyze\\nit. MEMS fabrication is based on chemical etching and photo-lithography. It consists of\\nbulk micro-machining, surface micro-machining, and high-aspect-ratio micro-machining\\nusing techniques, such as LIGA (Lithographie, Galvanoformung, Abformung-Lithography,\\nElectroplating, and Molding) [ 23]. New micro-manufacturing methods, including micro-\\nmechanical cutting, micro-electrical discharge machining, micro-electrochemical machining,\\nmicro-forming, laser technology, laser-assisted forming, replication techniques, deposition\\nmethods, etc., have been emerging to create a hybrid process. Multiple companies exist,\\nsuch as MEMSCAP Inc., IntelliSense Software Corp, ABAQUS, Inc., Coventor Inc., etc.,\\nand research bodies, such as U.C. Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University, TU Chemnitz, etc.,\\nwho are continuously working on providing improved solutions for MEMS design [ 24].\\nFigure 5 shows a high-level overview of the MEMS design structure ﬂow [ 25,26]. Given the\\nnumerous steps involved, several challenges occur at different levels, such as design issues,\\nfabrication issues, bulk micro-machining issues, dicing issues, packaging issues, technical\\nissues [27,28] etc.\\nAs stated in article [ 29], manufacturing defects can be categorized into the following\\nthree categories.\\n• Type A defects: These types of defects are evenly random with a stable mean density.\\nThere is no repeated occurrence or visible systematic pattern, i.e., the probability of a\\ndice being good or bad is equal. Thus, the root-cause analysis of such defects is not\\nstraightforward. Only an accurate and stable process can help reduce these kinds\\nof defects.'),\n",

These defects’ source can be generated from anomalies in the process\\nor machine, such as mask induced or during the variation while applying ﬁlms.\\n• Type C defects: The most common type of defect seen in semiconductor manufacturing\\nis Type C defect, a combination of Type A and Type B defects. It is essential to\\neliminate random defects to recognize and eradicate systemic ﬂaws. There can be\\nmultiple causes, such as structural defects coming from the raw material, asymmetrical\\npresence of contaminants, irregular presence of defect generation particles, etc.\\nAll these defects can be visible or invisible. The visible wafer defects can be clas-\\nsiﬁed as local, random, center, and scrape based on the visual pattern type.

Artiﬁcial Intelligence Application in MEMS System: Current Trends\\nDue to infrastructure advancement and data availability, disciplines such as data\\nscience and data analytics have gained signiﬁcant attention from an application perspective\\nin different domains, such as the MEMS sensors manufacturing process. Sampaio et al. [ 32],\\nCinar et al. [ 33], Podder et al. [ 34], Tariq et al. [ 35], Gupta et al. [ 36], Li et al. [ 37,38], and\\nShen et al. [ 39] have provided extensive overviews of ML applications for predictive main-\\ntenance application in the manufacturing domain of Industry 4.0. This provides a strong\\nmotivation for exploring AI beneﬁts in the MEMS domain. AI algorithms can efﬁciently\\nand effectively analyze massive amounts of data and identify particular trends and patterns\\nhumans cannot see, enabling process automation and discarding human intervention. Real\\ndata contains noise, complex patterns, multi-modal distributions, variance, etc., which\\nmakes the analysis computationally extensive and difﬁcult using traditional methods. AI\\nalgorithms are adept at managing multidimensional and multivariate data in dynamic or\\nuncertain environments. It is not predisposed toward particular datasets; thus, learning\\ncan, therefore, aid in minimizing bias in corporate choices. Data scarcity and conﬁdentiality\\ncan be challenging in certain domains in ﬁnding the optimal solution. This issue can be\\nhandled by different RNN variants or DL-based synthetic data generation. The beneﬁts of\\nthe AI algorithms are discussed, in detail, in Section 6.2.\\nIn this section, we surveyed the current trends of AI applications in different process\\nparts for MEMS-based sensors. MEMS gyroscopes and accelerometers have been scorch-\\ning research topics due to their diverse application in consumer, automotive, industrial,\\nand medical ﬁelds. Thus, more attention is given to improving and optimizing the hard-\\nware and software system for these two applications. A brief overview of AI algorithm\\nimplementation is discussed in Section 4.1. In Section 4.2, we investigated different ap-\\nplication areas of AI in MEMS-based sensors. In Section 4.3, AI application for the overall\\nMEMS manufacturing and design is covered.\\n4.1. AI Implementation Workﬂow\\nA high-level overview of AI algorithm implementation workﬂow is presented in\\nFigure 8, where the overall goal is to build an efﬁcient model using the collected data to\\nachieve a certain objective. Acquiring and getting the data ready for analysis is the ﬁrst\\nstage in any data science workﬂow. Typically, data are combined from many sources and\\ncome in various formats. Data pre-processing is followed after the data retrieval step. This\\nstep is the most resource and time extensive stage.\\nData cleaning is crucial to prevent errors from spreading to the data exploration phase,\\nwhich could lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn from the data. This step includes\\nmissing value imputation, format speciﬁcation, noise removal, etc. The next step, the data\\nexploration stage, ﬁnds the complex relationship and hidden patterns in the data. The data\\npreparation and transformation stage allows the data to be transformed according to the\\nmodel requirement. It includes feature engineering, data labeling, and data splitting. All\\nthese aforementioned three stages are iterative. The data are then divided into training\\nand test sets and sometimes into a third set called the validation set. The data used to ﬁt\\nthe model are called the training set. A validation set is the subset of data used to assess\\na model’s ﬁt to a training dataset while adjusting model hyperparameters. A test set is a\\nsample of data used to objectively assess how well a ﬁnal model ﬁts the training dataset.\\nModel preparation and training is the stage in which training data are used to train a\\nmodel and comprises the hyperparameter adjustment. Before delivering the ML model\\nin production to the end user, the trained model must be validated to ensure it satisﬁes\\nthe originally stated objectives. This is called model evaluation. After this, the model is\\nready to be deployed in production, followed by a monitoring stage to check the deployed\\nmodel’s performance using real-time and unseen data to make predictions or provide\\nrecommendations that are further logged. The articles analyzed in this review follow the\\naforementioned process. Depending on the objective, sometimes importance is given to\\nspeciﬁc steps, such as data pre-processing or model preparation, etc.'),\n",

AI implementation process ﬂow\\n4.2. AI Application in MEMS-Based Sensors\\nA MEMS IMU unit consists of a multi-axis gyroscope and accelerometer, which are\\nused for positioning and navigation systems when integrated with the global positioning\\nsystem (GPS). A MEMS IMU system is preferred over traditional solutions due to its higher\\naccuracy, small size, and lower cost. Compared to ﬁber or laser-based IMUs, MEMS-based\\nIMUs are susceptible to more deterministic and random errors, such as measurement,\\nquantization noise, alignment, bias, etc. Such uncompensated errors accumulate over time\\nand adversely impact the precision and sensitivity of the sensors. There exist mathematical\\nand statistical model-based calibration methods for error compensation. However, random\\nerrors (which contain high-frequency and low-frequency components) introduce drift and\\nbias into the Inertial Navigation System (INS). Thus, adequate signal de-noising schemes\\nare required to remove random errors. Allan Variance, Auto-Regressive, Moving Average,\\nand Wavelet De-noising methods exist for error modeling, but this still requires an accurate\\nmodel to ensure accuracy.\\nThe following papers [ 40–52] show that DL-based error compensation models can\\nlearn more characteristics of the reference signals, such as identifying the particular accel-\\nerations and angular velocities, in comparison to traditional calibration processes, such\\nas the six-position static test and rate test. It is crucial to note that the same deep learning\\nnetworks may eliminate different error sources from IMUs of any performance grade.\\nJiang et al. [ 40] proposed a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-\\nRNN) for MEMS IMU (MSI3200) de-noising, which outperformed the Auto-Regressive and\\nMoving Average (ARMA) method. This paper was limited to a static dataset and limited\\nlayers of LSTM-RNN and thus needed more experimentation. Jiang et al. [ 41] proposed\\na heterogeneous deep learning recurrent neural network (RNN) design to suppress the\\nMEMS gyroscope signal noise. Here, two deep-layered RNN algorithms, Gated Recurring\\nUnit (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), were used individually and mixed for\\nthe experimentation. The outcome of this analysis showed promising results for signiﬁcant\\nnoise reduction of the MEMS gyroscope using the LSTM-GRU network.'),\n",

[ 42] described a method using the three-axis Neural Architecture Search\\nRecurrent Neural Network (NAS-RNN) for noise modeling and compensation of MEMS\\nGyroscope for MEMS IMU STIM300 unit. The limitation of this approach was that the\\nexperiments were performed only on the STIM300 unit and using only RNN models.\\nNevertheless, this research paper demonstrates that incorporating DL in MEMS gyroscope\\ncan improve accuracy signiﬁcantly by reducing noise.\\nNevertheless, this research paper showcases the strength of incorporating a deep\\nlearning module in the MEMS gyroscope that can signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy by\\nreducing the noise.\\nJiang et al. [ 43] proposed an RNN variant called Simple Recurrent Unit (SRU-RNN) for de-\\nnosing MEMS IMU MSI3200 gyroscope signals. The authors claimed that SRU-RNN provided\\nsignificant advantages over the conventional approaches using SVM, LSTM, or LSTM-RNN\\nmethods. This research was limited to a single-layer SRU-RNN and fixed parameters.\\nThermal calibration of the MEMS gyroscope is required to compensate for error\\ndrift, which can affect the accuracy of the gyroscopes. Traditionally, polynomial ﬁtting\\nis performed to overcome this. The authors of [ 44–47] have shown that Artiﬁcial Neural\\nNetworks (ANN) have superior performance compared to the traditional method.\\nFei et al. [ 48] proposed a radial basis function (RBF) neural network-based control\\nscheme to reduce non-linearity during fabrication, such as drift, to improve the robustness\\nof the MEMS gyroscope. However, the proposed method might be prone to over-ﬁtting,\\nwhich is why Xing et al. [ 49] proposed a fusion algorithm consisting of least squares support\\nvector machine (LSSVM) [ 53] and chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO). It proved to\\nhave better performance than the backpropagation artiﬁcial neural network (BP-ANN) for\\nreducing the random drift of the MEMS gyroscope. The authors treated the problem as a\\nchaotic time series issue and performed signal de-noising. Using phase space reconstruction\\n(PSR) along with the C-C method helped with dimension and complexity reduction.\\nYang et al. [ 50] proposed a method that comprised a genetic algorithm (GA) and a\\nvery well-known and intensively used ML model, support vector machine (SVM), to solve\\nthe temperature drift in MEMS gyroscope.\\nInterestingly, S. Wang et al. [ 51] also used GA with an optimized backpropagation\\nneural network (BPNN) for temperature drift compensation. GA helped the BPNN to\\navoid local minimums by search optimization. The achieved result was 173 times better\\nthan the traditional polynomial ﬁtting.\\nMa et al. [ 52] targeted a similar issue of temperature drift by proposing a parallel\\napproach in their article. The presented method was more complete than the earlier\\napproaches discussed. The analysis included the signal value analysis along with temper-\\nature compensation. They decomposed the signal using Immune-Based Particle Swarm\\nOptimization (IPSO) for optimal Variational Modal Decomposition (VMD). After signal\\ndecomposition, the obtained intrinsic mode functions were further classiﬁed into the noise\\nterm (this was removed), the mixed term (consisting of both the noise and useful informa-\\ntion), and the feature term. The feature term contained the temperature drift, which was\\nfurther compensated by using Backpropagation (BP)-Adaboost prediction, which was then\\nmixed with the SG-ﬁltered mixed term to obtain the de-noised, temperature-compensated\\nsignal. The papers discussed above demonstrate that combining different disciplines,\\nsuch as GA and PSO, with AI can improve data analysis and understand and improve\\nmodel performance.\\nEffective ground vibration monitoring is crucial to avoid geological disasters, such\\nas earthquakes. Kang et al. [ 54] proposed a CNN-based monitoring scheme on MEMS\\nsensed data. The challenges were related to the collection and cleaning of the data, as the\\ndata contained noise, bias, offset errors, and different structures. Nonetheless, the authors\\nreached an overall accuracy of 98.82% with synthetic data and an accuracy of 81.64% on a\\nreal dataset.\\nAs mentioned, data scarcity is an issue regarding seismological research using low-cost\\nMEMS sensors. Moreover, the data quality is degraded due to inherent noise in accelerom-'),\n",

There have been many attempts [ 55–58] to capture the seismic sequence using AI\\nmodels. Still, these supervised approaches suffered from the incomplete reconstruction\\nof the seismic waveform, over-ﬁtting, and smaller dataset, unable to capture the diversity\\nof the waves. To overcome these challenges, Wu et al. [ 59] proposed a model Earthquake\\nGenerative Adversarial Network (EQGAN), an unsupervised technique to automatically\\ncapture and generate stable seismic waveform using the frameworks of GAN, LSTM,\\nand NN.\\nMEMS sensors have numerous applications in consumer electronics, such as pedes-\\ntrian navigation systems, and AI algorithms are intensively used for real-time path tracking,\\nactivity recognition, and posture recognition. Models such as tree-based algorithms (de-\\ncision tree, random forest, extreme gradient boosting), SVM, CNN, NN, and LSTM have\\nfound quite popular usages in such cases [60–64].\\nGao et al. [ 65] presented a multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with\\nadaptive learning for fault detection in MEMS inertial sensors in UAVs. The authors\\nclaimed that the proposed method could handle the temperature drift of inertial sen-\\nsors and achieved high fault detection accuracy compared to the strategies presented in\\npapers [66–71]. Amini et al. [ 72] developed an automated defect recognition system based\\non the Faster R-CNN Inception V2 COCO model by using a plenoptic image of the wafers\\nfor surface defect detection. The proposed method can be used for early fault detection at\\nwafer and component levels of MEMS, reducing the design time signiﬁcantly.\\nThus far, all the discussed papers are primarily related to industrial, automotive, or\\nconsumer-related use cases, which show promising results for AI applications in MEMS-\\nbased sensor applications. AI application for MEMS (BioMEMS) in healthcare is another\\npotentially colossal market [ 73]. Examples of general applications of MEMS in healthcare\\ncan be in a pedometer, hearing aid, body gateway, lab on a chip, blood pressure, etc. [ 74].\\nVashistha et al. [ 75], and Yadav et al. [ 76] have discussed AI applications to diagnose several\\ndiseases using MEMS sensor-based smart diagnostic devices using Mechanobiology, which\\nuses biosensors. MEMS are used here for ﬁnding external stimuli using force spectroscopy.\\nNN can detect environmental factors, such as viruses or bacteria, along with the traditional\\nmethod. To summarize, in most applications, different RNN and CNN models performed\\nbetter than the classical statistical models.\\n4.3. AI Applications in the MEMS Manufacturing and Design Process\\nMEMS reliability and fault mechanism research is still in its early stages. Failure\\nmechanisms differ signiﬁcantly from those found in traditional microelectronics. Faults or\\ndefects arise due to surface interaction energy and intermolecular forces. Fault detection\\nand maintenance are necessary for the MEMS fabrication process for reliability.\\nKeeping this in mind, Asgary et al. [ 77] proposed a fusion of a CNN and a Robust\\nHeteroscedastic Probabilistic Neural Network (RHPNN) for fault detection. The aim was\\nto provide a built-in self-test mechanism to implement in the ﬁnal testing round.\\nQuality Control is a signiﬁcant step in generating a superior category of sensors, which\\nis why defect detection is ubiquitous for MEMS manufacturing. Deng et al. [ 78] proposed\\na CNN-based defect detection scheme using image processing techniques for pressure\\nsensor chip packaging. The proposed accurate-detection CNN (ADCNN) algorithm was\\nused to detect defects, such as chip damage, chip scratch, wrinkles on the glass surface,\\nthe broken bond of the gold and aluminum wires, etc., with a mean average precision\\nof 92.39%.

Traditional methods, such as ﬁnite-element methods\\n(FEM) or ﬁnite-difference methods (FDM), are computationally heavy, creating a bottleneck\\nfor many simulations. To tackle this issue, Liang et al. [ 82] proposed an NN-based method\\nfor dynamic simulation and analysis of non-linearity in a MEMS-based system. The pro-\\nposed dimensionality reduction method consists of a Generalized Hebbian Algorithm\\n(GHA) [ 83]. GHA is based on the principle component analysis (PCA) of NN and the\\nGalerkin procedure. The authors claimed that this proposed model could replicate the\\ndesign and simulation method of PDE and can handle a large number of simulations in\\nless time, using less memory space. This can be very helpful to the MEMS system designer\\nfor optimizing the design process.\\nIn the technical report [ 84], author J.

The reliability of MEMS development has been a crucial factor\\nand is worth looking into. The author proposed a framework for the MEMS reliability\\nmodeling, a novel addition to the MEMS design. Guo et al. [ 85] proposed a data-driven\\ndeep neural network-based approach to replace the conventional FEA for the MEMS design\\ncycle. The author designed a non-parameterized NN-based model and trained it using\\ngeometric patterns to estimate the MEMS structure accurately, indicating the possibility of\\ndefect prediction in the microfabrication process.\\nDue to the increasing complexity of the MEMS manufacturing process, the number of\\nsurface defects tends to increase. It is crucial to detect these defects and identify the root\\ncause for yield improvement and overall process optimization. Chien et al.

In the ﬁrst step, a spatial ﬁlter was used to remove\\nrandom noise. Next, a splitter was used to separate the single and mixed patterns. Finally,\\na Deep Structured Convolutional Network (DSCN) model was used to ﬁnd the composite\\npattern.

They further\\nclaimed that this method could help build an information processing unit by eliminating\\nmicro-controllers in the process ﬂow.\\nLiu et al. [ 90] proposed a PC-based Expert System, ’EASYMEMS’, for MEMS design\\nand manufacturing. EASYMEMS covers three main aspects of MEMS-based systems:\\nmaterials, design, and manufacturing. It contains a knowledge-based engine to provide\\nexpert consultation and perform dynamic and static analysis. Although other software\\npackages exist, such as ACS and IntelliSuite, the authors claimed that their proposed\\nsystem could provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly framework based on the AI\\nexpert system.\\nGuo et al.

The authors claimed their system is almost\\n4000 times faster in detecting vibration modes for disk resonators. Although this is an\\nexciting result, the research needs further comparative analysis using other AI approaches.\\n5.

Q2: What Are the Advantages of AI-Based Solutions Compared to State-of-the-Art Solutions?\\nWith the advancement of graphics processor units (GPU), data abundance, and less\\nprocessing time [ 92,93], AI-based solutions have been integrated with more research areas.\\nIt can be seen in Figure 9 that since 2017, there has been a growth in the number of\\npublished articles; without any doubt, the most used algorithm type is ANN. Among all\\nthe papers used for the review, 78% of the authors used ANN-based solutions. ANN is\\nuseful for estimating complex and unknown functions with incomplete a priori knowledge.\\nIt has high fault tolerance, auto-correction mechanism, and parallel processing with easy\\napplication [ 94]. Looking deeper into the subcategories of the ANN algorithms, variants\\nof CNN type were used the most (31% of the total articles). Besides neural network-\\nbased models, tree-based models such as RF, AdaBoost, DT, and XGBoost and statistical\\nmodels such as SVM were also used. Tree-based models are relatively less complex and\\nstraightforward and easily explainable. Statistical models, such as SVM, NB, and PCA, are\\nphysically realizable and easily visualized. The following part summarizes the beneﬁts\\nobtained by using AI-based solutions.\\nAdvantages of Using AI:\\n• Hidden patterns, such as cross-correlation, in the data that are impossible with tradi-\\ntional methods can be discovered and visualized.\\n• Feature estimation can be enhanced in combination with traditional methods.\\n• Automated monitoring systems can be built for FDD and predictive maintenance without\\nany human in the loop. This reduces manual error and improves process accuracy .\\n• Elimination of prior knowledge dependency.\\n• MEMS manufacturing process improvement by eliminating iterative calibration steps\\nwith AI predictions.\\n• In the case of MEMS manufacturing, the sensing element fabrication process is sub-\\njected to different kinds of failures. AI methods can accurately perform image classiﬁ-\\ncation. it has proven to be useful for fault detection and recognizing substrate defects.\\n• Transfer learning helps apply previously gained knowledge to identify and detect\\nfeatures related to defects before the ﬁnal test.\\n• AI-based models can replace conventional design tools such as FEA for predicting\\nMEMS structural design steps with higher accuracy in less time.\\n• Overall, time-saving and process optimization can be achieved by incorporating AI.\\nTable 4 provides an in-depth analysis of the data features, data availability, model\\nperformance metrics used, and proposed AI algorithm advantages compared to the state-\\nof-the-art solution used in the articles analyzed in Table 3. The Data Features and Attributes\\ncolumn discusses the type, complexity, and limitation of the data used. Whether the data is\\navailable publicly is mentioned in the Data Availability column. The type of assessment cri-\\nterion used to validate the model, or the proposed solution is mentioned in the Performance\\nMetrics column. In the last column, Implemented AI Algorithm Advantage , key beneﬁts of the\\nproposed algorithm presented in the articles are highlighted.\\nTable 4.

Q3: What Are the Open Issues of Incorporating AI-Based Solutions in the MEMS Production\\nProcess? Does There Exist Any Standardized Framework to Integrate AI Solutions?\\nAI-based solutions are primarily data-driven, which is why after the Big Data growth\\nin Industry 4.0 at the beginning of 2000, the adaptation of such approaches was more\\nwelcomed in different industrial applications. This also poses challenges such as data\\ninsufﬁciency in certain use cases, data labeling, and data security issues. In Table 4, it was\\nshown that 63% of data were conﬁdential, whereas only 37% of the data were available\\npublicly. Data imbalance is another signiﬁcant issue faced by many researchers, and this\\nwas highlighted in the following articles [ 34,35,54,55,78,86]. It was reported in the arti-\\ncle [35] that data collection was challenging and time-consuming, and not all the traditional\\nfeatures, such as spread, level, and frequency centroid were used, which could have further\\nimproved the model accuracy. In article [ 40], it was mentioned that the collected raw data\\nwere noisy, and the computing power of the system used was limited. Moreover, the limited'),\n",

As can be seen\\nin the following articles [ 40–43,49,50], computational power limitation is a great challenge\\nfaced by many. Sometimes, training of the model was performed with a ﬁxed learning\\nrate and batch size, which can be further optimized and tuned to improve the model\\nperformance [ 43]. Moreover, even if the data were available, the amount or quality of data\\nwas not satisfactory, as reported in [40–43,48,49,55,56,62,64,78,88], or sometimes the data\\ncollection process was too exhaustive [ 72,77,85]. This is why synthetic data generation [ 101]\\nis gaining more and more attention for robust model creation.\\nThere exist other challenges from an adaptation and implementation perspective as\\nwell. The following lists the number of limitations posed by AI-based solution incorporation\\nin the MEMS ﬁeld.\\nChallenges of AI-Implementation in MEMS manufacturing:\\n• Most AI-based algorithms are data-driven. A larger amount of data provides a better-\\ntrained and more robust model. Insufﬁcient and unreliable data can degrade model\\nperformance during implementation.\\n• Data prepossessing is a crucial step to ensure data quality, i.e., the availability of\\nlabeled, noise-free data can ensure good training of the AI algorithm for higher\\naccuracy. This can be a time-consuming and challenging task.\\n• More computational power is required compared to the traditional methods.\\n• Some algorithms suffer from over-ﬁtting and bias.\\n• Explainability does not always exist.\\n• Plethora of algorithm availability can be challenging and cumbersome in ﬁnding the\\nﬁtting solution.\\n• Cross-domain knowledge is required.\\n• Infrastructure compatibility poses one of the biggest challenges as sometimes small\\nimplementations may need huge changes in the production process, which can be\\ntime-consuming.\\nCurrently, there exist many data mining process models, such as CRISP-DM (Cross\\nIndustry Standard Process for Data Mining) [ 102], SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify,\\nModel, and Assess) [ 103], KDD (Knowledge Discovery Databases) [ 104] etc.; where KDD\\ndescribes the process and CRISP-DM and SEMMA the implementation. Although these\\nare intensively used in small to large corporations, these methods lack problem clarity,\\ncontextualization, multiple reworks, iteration failure, etc. This is why ML-Ops (Machine\\nLearning Operation) is now one of the most suitable and industry-oriented end-to-end\\nsolutions for the incorporation of AI [ 105–107]. This ﬁeld is relatively new and thus needs\\nmore research work to be standardized.\\n7. Conclusions\\nThis review paper summarizes current evolutionary research approaches for MEMS\\nmanufacturing and design optimization from the device to the process. AI applications are\\nextensively used in different areas of MEMS system as it offers several beneﬁts, such as\\nautomation of processes, reduction of human error, predictive maintenance, efﬁcient infor-\\nmation handling, knowledge reproducibility, etc. AI-enabled approaches outperformed\\ntraditional optimization methods. These new methods are capable of multi-objective design\\noptimization in MEMS.\\nHowever, AI implementation has certain limitations when applied in industrial set-\\ntings. Great effort and time must be given at the data pre-processing stage. Data collection\\ncan be very demanding due to missing information; real data are highly unstructured\\nand noisy; unclear business requirement speciﬁcations make it more challenging to ﬁnd\\nthe right solution. As many algorithms and solutions are available for AI, it becomes\\nstrenuous to choose the correct answer, which can further lead to an increase in effort,\\ntime, and cost. Training models vary from case to case, which hinders the formulation of a\\ngeneralized solution. There can be infrastructure limitations that can lead to an increase in'),\n",
